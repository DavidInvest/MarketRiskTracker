### Data Layer
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy with declarative base
- **Models**: RiskScore, AlertConfig, SystemLog, BacktestResult, MLModel
- **Storage**: JSON columns for flexible data storage (market data, sentiment data, model parameters)

## Key Components

### Core Services
1. **DataCollector**: Aggregates market data from yfinance, Reddit, Twitter, and news APIs
2. **RiskCalculator**: Computes weighted risk scores from VIX, sentiment, DXY, and momentum indicators
3. **AlertSystem**: Multi-channel notifications via email, Discord, and Telegram
4. **MLIntegration**: Handles model loading, prediction, and crash probability assessment
5. **MLTrainer**: Manages model training with both synthetic and real historical data
6. **Backtester**: Performs historical strategy testing with portfolio simulation
